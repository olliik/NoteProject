Small project I built after getting fed up with the slow Windows 10 search/indexer. Instead of opening the text editor you search for, microsoft browser opens up with a bing search result.

    1. publish and executable file.
    2. set up PATH enviroment variable for the exe.
    3. one command opens up the text editor and pre-saves the file to a known location.
    4. arguments for folder/directory and the filename - parses .txt, .py and .cs file extensions.
